*Default Mode* | *Event Mode*

## Install
  
You can install this node directly from the "Manage Palette" menu in the Node-RED interface.  
Alternatively, run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red` on Linux or `%HOMEPATH%\.nodered` on Windows

        npm install node-red-contrib-ui-time-scheduler

### Requirements ###
node-red v0.19 or above  
node-red-dashboard v2.10.0 (v2.15.4 or above would be ideal)
  
## Usage
  
Add a time-scheduler-node to your flow. Open the dashboard, you will see an empty scheduler.
Click the plus sign at the top right corner of the node to create a new schedule.
  
### Output
  
Whenever you add or delete a schedule a JSON string is sent to its top output. This JSON string contains all schedules.

Every other output (number of total outputs depends on how many devices you have added) emits true/false every 60 seconds. In Event Mode true/false is only sent at the specified time. Adjusting the refresh rate and the number of devices is possible within the node's options.
  
Tip: If you want to block values unless the value has changed, add a RBE node to the desired outout.

### Input & restoring schedules after a reboot
  
You can use the JSON string from the nodes top output to directly inject timers after a (re)boot or (re)deploy:

If you changed the node-red <a target="blank" href="https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/context#context-stores">contextStorage to localfilesystem</a>, schedules are automatically saved and restored after a reboot.
